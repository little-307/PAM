# PAM (Pixel Art Maker) Bootcamp assignment.

Here I used a theme inspired by the original Nintendo system and a few of my favorites from back in the day.

Note: I want to try one that will be Lego themed, but to be able to track the amount of cells that hold each color used. 
  My idea would be to create a portrait using 3-6 colors that can be possibly automated by importing an image, or by tracing the image set on the canvas area.
  Each color used will have a counter to be able to order the correct amount of Lego pieces to assemble at home.
  Maybe evlove this to a 3D version and slowly include different Lego shapes. Sounds like a fun challenge.
